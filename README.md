# Python_EstimateNanoParticleSize
Python code to plot data and estimate a Nanoparticle size using a files which includes the values of intensities and angles
The code will plot the data in a form of a graph and returns the estimated size. 

The code is implemented such that the value returned is as approximate to the nanoparticle size using materials and chemical engineering concepts learned in first year of General Engineering at McMaster University.
