# Python_EstimateNanoParticleSize

Python code to preform data analysis to estimate the size of a nanoparticle. Analyzing 1000s of data points collected of the intensity and angle within a text file. 
The code will plot the data in a form of a graph and returns the estimated size. 

Libraries included: PyLab and Math. 

The code is implemented such that the value returned is as approximate to the nanoparticle size using materials and chemical engineering concepts learned in first year of General Engineering at McMaster University.
